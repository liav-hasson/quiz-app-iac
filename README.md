# Quiz-app Infrastructure As Code

This repository contains Terraform IaC that deployes the entire framework of the project.
Additionally, I use Bash scripting to manage infrastructure deployment, extracting data and sending notifications.

## About The Quiz-app Project

The Quiz-app is a DevOps learning platform build by a DevOps student.
The app lets the user select a category, a sub-category and a difficulty, then generates a question about a random keyword in that subject. The user then answers the question, and recieves a score, and short feedback.

All the code is fully open source, and contains 5 main repositories:
- **[Frontend repository](https://github.com/liav-hasson/quiz-app-frontend.git)** - React frontend that runs on Nginx.
- **[Backend repository](https://github.com/liav-hasson/quiz-app-backend.git)** - Flask Python backend logic.
- **[GitOps repository](https://github.com/liav-hasson/quiz-app-gitops.git)** - ArgoCD App-of-app pattern.
- **[IaC repository](https://github.com/liav-hasson/quiz-app-iac.git) << You are here!** - Terraform creates oll the base infrastructure, on AWS.
- **[Mini-version repository](https://github.com/liav-hasson/quiz-app-mini.git)** - Allows you to self-host localy, or on AWS.
